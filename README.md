## What is LottoApp?
Lotto Brainy is an entirely dynamic, full responsive lottery drawing application that simplifies the user experience in finding Powerball and Megamillions drawings. 

## What are Lotto Brainy's features?
After reading the Lotto Brainy landing page which outlines the primary features of the app, you'll see two lottery "modules".  Lotto Brainy was built with future expandability in mind, so additional lotteries could be incorporated into the app but for now the two lotteries you (the user) will see are MegaMillions and Powerball. 

Each lottery has their own special "module" that contain the following features:
* Lottery name 
* Current drawing numbers (including megaball/powerball and powerball multiplier/megaplier)
* Next Draw Countdown (shown in days until next countdown occurs)
* MegaMillions history (shows previous 8 drawings)
* Powerball history (shows previous 8 drawings)

To take a look at the history of each lottery, all you need to do is click on the "History" link and you'll be shown the past 8 drawings.  To exit the history section, all you need to do is click "Exit" at the bottom of the window.

If you would like to go back to the landing page for Lotto Brainy, click the "Learn more about this app" link below the current modules.
